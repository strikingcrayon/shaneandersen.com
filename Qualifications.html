        <h1>Qualifications</h1>
        <p>The following is a 414 word, highly abridged, autobiography.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was born around dinner-time on an early spring day in 1987.</p>
<p>I've run, built, left, lost, sold, and been heavily involved with, many businesses. Some were awesome, some sucked; Most were successes, but some were failures. A few, even brutally so. In both regards.</p>
<p>For 20 years I travelled the western third of North America extensively.</p>
<p>I grew up in the hills of rural Vancouver. Law was merely a veneer and order little more than an accident of plenty. Though a ten minute drive in any direction would take you where few saw the same setting.</p>
<p>I didn't learn to stop running until sometime after I married my wife in the summer of 2010. I didn't learn to calm down, until the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>When I was 5-years-old I was trapped between languages. If not for my grasp of pantomime and performance, alongside my electric typewriter, I would have been considered non-verbal.</p>
<p>At 12-years-old I was a lifeguard and a camp counsellor. Though I quit when I was 18, for six summers I looked after children while I was still a child myself.</p>
<p>I spent my 18th to 20th years mostly homeless and drifting inside a travelling sales cult before single-handedly cleaning up the mess of its collapse. The cult's last year of eight, being my only. Its dissolution, happening in my hometown.</p>
<p>Later, I'd spend a non-consecutive decade as a Certified Financial Planner<a href="https://www.fpcanada.ca/" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<p>My only siblings are my parents accounting practices. My father's, my elder, and my mother's, my younger. My mother is the Accountant. A CGA absorbed by the CPA, who did not start her career independently until tyranny demanded it. A process I lived through from 5-12 years old. My father? Merely a bookkeeper. Quite like me, but born in the first winter of Copenhagen's WWII.</p>
<p>I've been a netizen since 1993. And I was eleven when I got the internet on a dedicated line in my own room.</p>
<p>I can recall most anything I've ever paid attention to.</p>
<p>I've read a lot. And seen near as much myself in the flesh.</p>
<p>Whether by chronic or acute injury and illness, street warfare, life-saving surgeries, or just hillbilly nonsense, I've had my fair share of near-death experiences.</p>
<p>I've dragged the drowning from death.</p>
<p>I have seen the dark spectre of nothingness, and I have screamed in its face.</p>
<p>I have witnessed tragedy become hell due to the failings of myself and others.</p>
<p>I'm qualified for what I say I am.</p>
