        <h1>Qualifications</h1>
        <p>The following is a 480 word, highly abridged, autobiography.</p>
<hr>
        <p>I was born around dinner-time on an early spring day in 1987.</p>
        <p>At 23-years-old, I became the youngest Canadian CFP ever. Quitting for independence the day I earned my marks, I spent a decade as a Certified Financial Planner<a href="https://www.fpcanada.ca/" target="_blank">.</a></p>
        <p>My only siblings are my parents accounting practices. My father's, my elder, and my mother's, my younger. My mother being the actual accountant. A CGA absorbed by the CPA, who did not start her career independently until Monetary Hegemony demanded it. A process I lived through from 5-12 years old. But my father, is just like me, though born in the first winter of Denmark's WWII.</p>
        <p>For 20 years I travelled the western third of North America extensively.<br>Better the wilderness, than civilization.</p>
        <p>I didn't learn to stop running until sometime after I married my wife in the summer of 2010.</p>
        <p>I've run, built, left, lost, sold, been heavily involved with, and even one time had stolen from me, many businesses. A lot of them were awesome and some of them sucked; Most were successes, but some were failures. A few, even brutally so. In both regards.</p>
        <p>I grew up in the hills of rural Vancouver. Law was merely a veneer and order little more than an accident of plenty. Though, a 10 minute drive in any direction would take you where few believed, until recently.</p>
        <p>When I was 5-years-old I was trapped between languages. If not for my grasp of pantomime and performance, alongside my electric typewriter, I would have been considered non-verbal.</p>
        <p>At 12-years-old I was a lifeguard and working as a volunteer camp counsellor. By 14 I was being paid. As I was an adult on paper. My "adultness" being thanks to confusions, coercion, and outright fraud. Plus some notoriety. Bought with audacity and accomplishment. Though I quit when I was 18, for six summers I looked after children while I was still a child myself.</p>
        <p>I spent my 18th to 20th years mostly homeless and drifting inside a travelling sales cult before single-handedly cleaning up the mess of its collapse. The cult's last year of eight, being my only. Its dissolution, happening in my hometown.</p>
        <p>I've been a netizen since 1993. I was eleven when I got the internet on a dedicated line in my own room.</p>
        <p>I can recall most anything I've ever paid attention to. This is as much a gift as it is a curse. As I've read a lot. And seen near as much myself.</p>
        <p>Whether by chronic or acute injury and illness, street warfare, life-saving surgeries, or just hillbilly nonsense, I've had my fair share of near-death experiences.</p>
        <p>I've dragged the drowning from death.</p>
        <p>I have seen the dark spectre of nothingness, and I have screamed in its face.</p>
        <p>I have witnessed tragedy become hell due to the failings of myself and others.</p>
        <p>I'm qualified for whatever I say I am.</p>
