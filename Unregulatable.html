<h2> I am a Practicing Practical Philosopher: </h2>
<p>I figure out how to get what you want done, done.<br>
I worry long term, so you can focus short term.<br>
I keep money and madness out of the way of your meaning.
</p>
<p>
I operate a proprietorship which secures time as net profit. I officiate my family's Economic Ark.<br>
I am a freelance brain for hire. A <s>redacted</s> advisor. A manager, and a solarpunk fixer. <br>
Imagine a family docotor but for wealth instead of health. <br>
An accountant and a lawyer, mixed into one, who is most assuredly neither. <br>
A therapist, who cares more about your best self, than whoever you are today.
</p>

<h2> Who do I help? </h2>
<p><b>Generally:</b> Those who can manage frank introspection, honest communication, and a good faith subjugation of their Ego.<br>
<b>Specifically:</b> Those who can answer in the affirmative to at least one of the three following questions:</p>

<p><b>Do you command your own time?</b><br>
	<sup><b>AKA:</b> Do you have extra hours to spend?</sup></p>
<p><b> Do you have an excess of capital?</b><br>
	<sup><b>AKA:</b> Can you afford to pay me?</sup></p>
<p><b> Can you speak Truth and shackle your demons?</b><br>
	<sup><b>AKA:</b> Are you brave? Are you Good?</sup></p>
<p>
<b>Customers</b> must answer in the affirmative to one of the above questions.<br>
<b>Clients</b> must answer in the affirmative to two of the above questions.<br>
