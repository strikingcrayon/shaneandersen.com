<p> I am unregulated as I am unregulatable.<br>I am self regulated, as a matter of last resort.<br>I am regulated by my community, as all identities must be.</p>
<p> I wear multiple hats because the hats available to us can't agree.<br>There is no conformable speech for speaking Truth.<br> I, like you, are incompressible. No hats are we.</p>

<h2> I am a Practising Practical Philospher: </h2>
<p>I figure out how to get what you want done, done.<br>
I worry long term, so you can focus short term.<br>
I keep money and madness out of the way of your meaning.
</p>
<p>
I operate a proprietorship which secures time as a net profit to all. I administrate my family's Economic Ark.<br>
I am a freelance brain for hire. A <s>redacted</s> advisor. A manager, and a fixer. <br>
Imagine a family doctor, but for wealth, instead of health. I secure legacy. <br>
An accountant and a lawyer, mixed into one, who is most assuredly neither. <br>
A therapist, who cares more about your best self, than whoever you are today. <br>
A mathematician disillusioned with certainty, an ethicist, and a survivor.
</p>

	<li><b> Do you have an excess of capital?</b></li>
		<sup><b>AKA:</b> Can you afford to pay me significantly in currency?</sup>
	<li><b> Can you speak Truth and shackle your demons?</b></li>
		<sup><b>AKA:</b> Are you brave? Are you Good?</sup>
</ul>
<div>
<p> <b>Customers</b> must answer in the affirmative to one of the above questions.<br>
